Day 1 – Data Analytics Bootcamp

Today’s focus: Setting up my environment and understanding the roadmap.

What I did today:
- Installed Anaconda for managing Python packages and environments.
- Set up VS Code as my main code editor.
- Explored Google Colab for running notebooks online.
- Reviewed the roadmap for the entire bootcamp to plan my learning path.

Tools Installed:
- Anaconda: Makes it easy to manage Python and data science libraries.
- VS Code: Lightweight, flexible code editor with great extensions.
- Google Colab: Free, cloud-based Jupyter notebooks for quick prototyping.

Bootcamp Roadmap (Outline of what I’ll cover over the next few weeks):
1. Python Basics – variables, data types, control flow
2. Data Analysis – pandas, numpy
3. Data Visualization – matplotlib, seaborn
4. Statistics & Probability – foundations for analysis
5. SQL for Data – querying and joining data
6. Real-world Projects – applying all the skills
7. Sharing Work on GitHub – building my portfolio

Reflections:
Starting is the most important step. Today was about laying the foundation and getting my tools ready. Excited for what’s next!

Next Up (Day 2 Preview):
- Setting up my first Python notebook.
- Running basic Python code.
- Exploring JupyterLab/Colab features in more detail.
